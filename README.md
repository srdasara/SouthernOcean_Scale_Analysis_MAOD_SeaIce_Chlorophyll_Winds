# Southern Ocean-Scale Analysis
Here I've compiled my code for some preliminary data analysis on southern ocean scale variables, including marine aerosol optical depth (MAOD), depolarization ratio (sea ice), chlorophyll-a concentration, and wind speed. This research is still in the works, but what is interesting is that spatial clustering of MAOD & sea ice, MAOD & wind speed, and sea ice & chlorophyll-_a_ concentration is significant. More work to follow!
